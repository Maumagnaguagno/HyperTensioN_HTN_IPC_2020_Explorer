**View HyperTensioN HTN IPC 2020 domain modifications**

[HyperTensioN](../../../HyperTensioN) is able to modify planning descriptions and output to many different formats.
One of these formats is [DOT](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html), which is a graph output we can use to visualize the domain structure.
Here we have all HTN IPC 2020 planning instance graphs with different domain modifications employed by HyperTensioN during the [IPC](../../../HyperTensioN/blob/master/docs/IPC.md).
The graphs can be visualized in the browser, being client-rendered by [d3-graphviz](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz).
